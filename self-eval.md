# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
  I really struggled to make sense of everything on Wednesday and then struggled to build on it on Thursday and Friday. I feel like I will struggle a lot in Mod 1 as well.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
  It's going okay except for Friday. I think as long as I don't feel like I'm struggling I can take breaks but if I feel overwhelmed then I'm less likely to take a break.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
  Just a lot of practice and a lot of luck honestly. I'm expecting to fail Mod 1 and take it over again based on how Mod 0 went.
  I think more of us utilizing the main channel and study hall would help, but so far everyone has been responsive and supportive.
